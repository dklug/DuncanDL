# DuncanDL
A web crawling file downloader using Scrapy
 * For reference https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html
 * I made this for Shawn Newsam's Fall 2018 schedule for CSE 107 - Intro to Digital Image processing because I didn't want to manually download each file off of his schedule, but the code can be extended to other websites potentially.
 * Website that I crawl: http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/snewsam/CSE107/schedule.html

## Setup before running:

* https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html
  
## To run crawler on Newsam's schedule:

* scrapy crawl newsam
